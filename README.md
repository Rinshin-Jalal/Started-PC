## Hi ðŸ‘‹

 `I just Build a Script that messages to discord using discord webhook`
 
 You can use this as well
 You just have to add your discord hook url to the variable in 

 ```python
  URL = "Your discord webhook url"
 ```
 And add it your startup scripts
 
 
 ### INSTALL THESE PACKAGES AS WELL

```bash
 pip install opencv-python
 pip install discord-webhook
```
